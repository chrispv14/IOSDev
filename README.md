# 📱 IOSDev – Group Project App

## 🎯 Overview
This iOS application was developed as part of our university group project for the subject **42889 / 41889 – Application Development** at UTS. The goal was to design and implement a functional app that solves a real-world problem using the **Product Design Cycle**, with iterative prototyping, development, and testing.

## 👥 Team
This project was completed by a group of 3 students under the **Faculty of Engineering and IT, School of Computer Science**.

## 🛠 Features
- Built entirely in **Swift** using **Xcode**.
- Fully functional iOS app designed around a real-world use case.
- UI optimized for ease of use and visual appeal.
- Includes unit tests and UI tests via `IOSDevTests` and `IOSDevUITests`.
